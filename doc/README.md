How to build Sphinx documents?
------------------------------

In order to see documentations in a human-redable form, you need to build them.

First, you need to install Sphinx. Either get it from its website (http://sphinx-doc.org), or install it using pip: ``pip install sphinx``.

Then, come to this directory, and run "Make html". You can find the output in the "Build" directory.

You can also build the output in other formats. Run "make" for more information.
