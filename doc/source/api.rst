API of the World Server
=======================

This document explains the API that a robot should use to interact with the server.

Exceptions
----------

If any errors occur, client will receive a dictionary like these::

    {"status": 500,
     "error_code": "AuthenticationFailedError",
     "error_message": "Wrong password for Robot 6542.6.876"}

=========================================  =====================================
Error Code                                 Description
=========================================  =====================================
InvalidJSONError                           The JSON client sent is in a wrong format, or missed some mandatory fields.
InvalidHttpMethodError                     Server only accepts POST HTTP method. Client will receive this error if it tries to use other method.
InvalidArgumentsError                      Raises if arguments of an action (command) are not correct.
InvalidActionError                         Raises when specified command (action) does not exists or invalid.
DatabaseException                          Normally, client shouldn't receive this error. Most of the times, it means there's something wrong with the server.
CannotAddRobotError                        Raises when there is a problem for adding a robot to the database.
                                           Common causes:
                                               Robot ID is already exists.
                                               Memcached is not started.
                                               Memory is full.
RobotNotFoundError                         Raises if a robot cannot be found on the database. Usually, because the provided robot ID is wrong.
CouldNotSetValueBecauseOfConcurrencyError  Raises if two or more concurrent requests received by server and it couldn't handle it. Upon receiving this, client should retry its previous request.
InvalidPasswordError                       Specified password is wrong.
InvalidLocationError                       Specified location is not valid. For example, it's out of the world.
LockAlreadyAquiredError                    Two or more concurrent requests happened and server couldn't handle it. Client should retry its action.
AuthenticationFailedError                  Raises if a robot could not be authenticated. i.e. it's password is wrong, or it's dead.
WorldIsFullError                           Normally, it shouldn't happen! If it is, it means all the world is filled with blocking objects. No one can move!
