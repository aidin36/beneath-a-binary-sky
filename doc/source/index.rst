What is it?
--------------

Beneath a Binary Sky is a programming game. It means, players are not humans, but programs. Gamer writes a program (a robot) and set it to live on a simulated world. The goal of each robot is to live longer, and produce more childern.

Unlike most of similar games out there, Beneath a Binary Sky is a peaceful world. The goal is not to kill other robots and prove that you're the strongest, rather it about co-operating to make a better living, a better world.

.. TODO: A photo that shows a robot and a plant, and it should note that "robots should agriculture in order to make food".

* If a plant don't receive water for a while, it will die.

* If a robot ran out of energy, it will die.

* Robots also age. They will die after living for a specific time. They should try to give birth to new children if they want to become extinct.

* Robots need to gain an amout of honour, in order to gain allowance of giving birth. Honour will be given to the robots who contribute to the society, by making plants reach their maturity.
