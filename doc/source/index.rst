What is it?
--------------

Beneath a Binary Sky is a programming game. It means, players are not humans, but programs. Gamer writes a program (a robot) and set it to live on a simulated world. The goal of each robot is to live longer, and produce more childern.

Unlike most of similar games out there, Beneath a Binary Sky is a peaceful world. The goal is not to kill other robots and prove that you're the strongest, rather it about co-operating to make a better living, a better world.

.. TODO: A photo that shows a robot and a plant, and it should note that "robots should agriculture in order to make food".
