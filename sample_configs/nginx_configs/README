To setup NGINX using these sample configs, simply copy `binary-sky.config' into
`/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/'.
Also, copy certificates (.crt and .key files) into `/etc/nginx/ssl-certs/`.

WARNING: These certificates are self-signed. These should only use for testing
the server locally. For deplying server somewhere public, use real certificates!
Take this warning seriously!
